## 2.1.4 (@@YYYYMMDD@@)

### First-time install of DkML

Before you run the installer: Make sure your Windows username does not contain a space character (e.g. for `C:\Users\Jane Smith`, OCaml will not install properly).

Run the following in a terminal (either Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt):

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools --override "--wait --passive --installPath C:\VS17 --addProductLang En-us --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.14.38.17.8.x86.x64 --includeRecommended"
winget install Git.Git
winget install Diskuv.OCaml
```

And then in a **NEW** terminal:

```powershell
dk Ml.Switch init --system
```

### Upgrading from version 2.1.0 or later

In PowerShell or Command Prompt:

```powershell
winget remove dkml # Ignore "exit code: 4294967295"
winget install dkml
```

### Upgrading from versions earlier than 2.1.0

1. Download and run the "Windows/Intel 64-bit Native Uninstaller" from [DkML Releases 2.1.3](https://gitlab.com/dkml/distributions/dkml/-/releases/2.1.3).
2. Open **Add or remove programs** from Windows Search (type Windows key and then start typing "Add or remove programs")
   * Uninstall `Diskuv OCaml` and/or `DkML Native` and/or `DkML Bytecode` if you see them; you can ignore any failures. You can now close "Add or remove programs".
3. In PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   winget install dkml
   ```

### What do I do after the install is complete?

You SHOULD read the "Install is done! What next?" at <https://diskuv.com/dkmlbook/#install-is-done-what-next> documentation.

If you had any existing local switches, upgrade them by doing `dkml init`, `opam upgrade` and `opam install . --deps-only` in the local switch directories.

For projects using [`setup-dkml` (part of  `dkml-workflows`)](https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-workflows#dkml-workflows)
for their GitHub Actions / GitLab CI:

1. Re-run `dk Ml.Switch init`, `opam upgrade` and `opam install . --deps-only` in your project
2. Follow the THIRD step of <https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-workflows#configure-your-project>

### Major Changes

* bugfix: `dk Ml.Switch init` was broken on 32-bit architectures. DkML 2.1.2 had incorrectly pinned the `host-arch` of the master DkML build machine. <https://gitlab.com/dkml/distributions/dkml/-/issues/27>
* performance: The `Opam pins for dkml switch` step of DkML workflows no longer takes 40 minutes for `dockcross` Linux containers. <https://gitlab.com/dkml/distributions/dkml/-/issues/29>

### Usage Notes

* You can continue to use `dkml.exe` and `with-dkml.exe` but both are deprecated; the new (unified) executable is `dk.exe`. See [Deprecated Commands](#deprecated-commands-in-212) in the release notes.
* Once every two weeks DkML news about new versions, errata, uninstalling, etc. will be shown on a webpage. It is triggered from the now deprecated `dkml init`, the replacement `dk Ml.Switch init` and the `with-dkml` proxy commands, and can be disabled with `dk Ml.News disable`. In particular, use `dk Ml.News` to show the news if you are experiencing problems with DkML.

### Known Issues

* The DkML compiler does not support Android NDK 24+ for `android_arm32v7a` because of an unresolved OCaml compiler bug that generates duplicate assembler (`.s`) labels, even if you target NDK 23. NDK 24+ dropped the GNU AS assembler which tolerated duplicated labels. <https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-compiler/issues/6>

### Deprecated Commands in 2.1.2+

The deprecated commands still work, but will first display the new command on the standard error and then pause for 15 seconds.

| Old Command      | New Command     | Example                   |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| `dkml init`      | `dk Ml.Switch`  | `dk Ml.Switch init`       |
|                  | `dk Ml.News`    | `dk Ml.News show`         |
| `dkml version`   | `dk Ml.Version` | `dk Ml.Version show`      |
| `with-dkml bash` | `dk Ml.Use`     | *(1)* `dk Ml.Use -- bash` |

(1)  `with-dkml bash` / `with-dkml python3` / etc will not pause for 15 seconds.

### Minor Changes

* stdout is redirected from crossplatform-functions.sh's `autodetect_compile()` `--post-transform` scripts to stderr
* fix dkml-compiler's `env/github-actions-ci-to-ocaml-configure-env.sh` to work with latest Android NDK on GitHub Actions. errata: `android_arm32v7a` has a problem with duplicate labels b/c GitHub Actions uses NDK 27 now (anything NDK24+ will use stricter clang assembler rather than GNU AS assembler).

### Upgraded opam packages

| Package                     | From  | To    |
| --------------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| dkml-install,dkml-install-* | 0.5.2 | 0.5.3 |
