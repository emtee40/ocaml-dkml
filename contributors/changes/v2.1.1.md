## 2.1.1 (@@YYYYMMDD@@)

### First-time install of DkML

Before you run the installer: Make sure your Windows username does not contain a space character (e.g. for `C:\Users\Jane Smith`, OCaml will not install properly).

Run the following in a terminal (either Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt):

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2019.BuildTools --override "--wait --passive --installPath C:\VS --addProductLang En-us --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --includeRecommended"
winget install Git.Git
winget install Diskuv.OCaml
```

And then in a **NEW** terminal:

```powershell
dkml init --system
```

### Upgrading from version 2.1.0

In PowerShell:

```powershell
1..6 | % {  @("bash","sh","with-dkml","ocamllsp","git","opam","dune","ocamlrun") | % { taskkill /F /IM "$_.exe" }; Start-Sleep 1 }

winget upgrade dkml
```

### Upgrading from versions earlier than 2.1.0

1. In PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   1..6 | % {  @("bash","sh","with-dkml","ocamllsp","git","opam","dune","ocamlrun") | % { taskkill /F /IM "$_.exe" }; Start-Sleep 1 }
   ```

2. Open **Add or remove programs** from Windows Search (type Windows key and then start typing "Add or remove programs")
   1. Uninstall `Diskuv OCaml` and/or `DkML Native` and/or `DkML Bytecode` if you see them; you can ignore any failures. You can now close "Add or remove programs".
   2. Download and run the "Windows/Intel 64-bit Native Uninstaller" from [DkML Releases 2.1.1](https://gitlab.com/dkml/distributions/dkml/-/releases/2.1.1).
3. Open PowerShell and run the following:

   ```powershell
   if (Test-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\DkMLNative\bin) { del -force -recurse $env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\DkMLNative\bin }
   if (Test-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\DkMLNative\usr\bin) { del -force -recurse $env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\DkMLNative\usr\bin }
   ```

4. In PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   winget install dkml
   ```

### What do I do after the install is complete?

You SHOULD read the "Install is done! What next?" at <https://diskuv.com/dkmlbook/#install-is-done-what-next> documentation.

If you had any existing local switches, upgrade them by doing `dkml init`, `opam upgrade` and `opam install . --deps-only` in the local switch directories.

For projects using [`setup-dkml` (part of  `dkml-workflows`)](https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-workflows#dkml-workflows)
for their GitHub Actions / GitLab CI:

1. Re-run `dkml init`, `opam upgrade` and `opam install . --deps-only` in your project
2. Follow the THIRD step of <https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-workflows#configure-your-project>

*And* if you have installed the Bytecode Edition, you no longer need it! Do:

1. Open Windows Explorer
2. Navigate to the folder `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs`
3. Delete the `DkMLByte` folder

### Major Changes

* OCaml upgraded to 4.14.2 from 4.14.0
* Dune upgraded to 3.15.0 from 3.12.1
* The opam repository is fixed to [commit 6c3f73f42890cc19f81eb1dec8023c2cd7b8b5cd](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/tree/6c3f73f42890cc19f81eb1dec8023c2cd7b8b5cd) for stability. If you need a new version of a package and can't wait for the next version of DkML, you can pin that package's url (recommended) or float the opam repository with `opam repository set-url default git+https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository.git#main`.
* Windows SDK 10.0.22621.0 and VC 17.8 (14.38) added to allowed list. This supports Visual Studio 2022, especially for GitLab CI.
* New supported package: `tiny_httpd`

### Known Issues

* DkML is not yet supported on the Opam 2.2.0 beta series. The feature flag `DKML_FEATURE_FLAG_POST_OPAM_2_2_BETA2=ON` environment variable may be used once a working version of opam.exe (perhaps opam 2.2 beta3) has been placed in your PATH.
* macOS installs to `~/Applications/DkMLNative` rather than `~/Applications/DkMLNative.app` with an Application Bundle directory structure. In fact, not even sure that OCaml can be coherently packaged as an Application Bundle.
* If you do move the installation directory or use the `--prefix` installer option on macOS or Linux, create a file `~/.local/share/dkml/dkmlvars-v2.sexp` (or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/dkml/dkmlvars-v2.sexp`) with the contents: `(("DiskuvOCamlHome" ("/path/to/new/install/dir")))`
* The opam sandbox is disabled because the paths to `~/Applications/DkMLNative` (etc.) are not known today to the opam sandbox. Worse, you can change the installation directory and the opam sandbox won't know about it.

### Architectures

| Architecture            | Reason                                        |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ✅︎ `windows_x86_64`      |                                               |
| ❌ `windows_x86`         | Haven't gotten around to it setting up CI     |
| ✅︎ `darwin_arm64`        |                                               |
| ❌ `darwin_x86_64`       | Resolvable issue with old `ctypes.0.19.2` (1) |
| ❌ `linux_x86_64`        | Issue with `ocaml-lsp-server.1.16.2` (2)      |
| ❌ `linux_x86`           | Haven't gotten around to it setting up CI     |
| ✅︎ `oldolddebian_x86_64` | (3)                                           |

* (1) This architecture has problems building with an old, patched version of `ctypes.0.19.2`. There is no problem with `darwin_arm64`. So likely easy to fix but low-priority.
* (2) This architecture is built with ManyLinux 2014 based on CentOS 7, which has an ancient glibc so it is portable to most Linux distros. However, ocaml-lsp-server.1.16.2 submodules the `lev` package which does not compile with ManyLinux. Unclear why but not investigating because very low-priority.
* (3) Internally named `linux_x86_64` but built from Debian oldold (currently 10 "buster") rather than CentOS 7. The binaries work on most of the major Linux non-EOL glibc distributions except CentOS 7.

### Bug Fixes

* You can now set the `OPAMROOT` environment variable to point to a directory where you'll save disk space. Your packages and projects are not transferred, however, to the new directory. Setting `OPAMROOT` is only recommended before installing DkML.

### Patches

| Package                | What                              | Issue                                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `base_bigstring.v16.0` | Implement `memmem` for Windows    | <https://github.com/janestreet/base_bigstring/issues/6> |
| `core_kernel.v0.16.0`  | MSVC fix didn't make it to 0.16.0 | <https://github.com/janestreet/core_kernel/pull/107>    |

### Internal Changes

* `DiskuvOCamlForceDefaults=1` will skip any DkML variables detection from an old installation. When used with dkml-base-compiler it will refind its own Visual Studio installation rather than use what was detected during DkML installation.
* There used to be `bootstrap_opam_version` and `FDOPEN_OPAMEXE_BOOTSTRAP` parameters for dkml-workflows (CI) that was independent of the DkML release. Now which opam is used is tied to what is tested during a DkML release.

### Likely Permanent Incompatibilities

* The `diskuv-opam-repository`, in particular patches for `ocaml-config`, are required in addition to the main opam repository. The correct repositories are selected when `dkml init` is used to create a local switch. Why can't it be upstreamed? There were changes done to the `ocaml-config` package to recognize the process name `ocaml-real` that comes from the shim `ocaml <spawns> ocaml-real`. The shim is required to get OCaml to accept arbitrary user installation directories (aka. "relocation"). However, new versions past `ocaml-config.3` are restricted to only OCaml 5 which is not an option for DkML.
