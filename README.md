# DkML 2.1.0

The DkML distribution is an open-source set of software
that supports software development in pure OCaml. The distribution's
strengths are its:

* full compatibility with OCaml standards like Opam, Dune and ocamlfind
* laser focus on "native" development (desktop software, mobile apps and embedded software) through support for the standard native compilers like Visual Studio
  and Xcode
* ease-of-use through simplified installers and simple productivity commands; high school students should be able to use it
* security through reproducibility, versioning and from-source builds

Do not use this distribution if you have a space in your username
(ex. `C:\Users\Jane Smith`).

These alternatives may be better depending on your use case:

* Developing in a Javascript first environment? Have a look at [Esy and Reason](https://esy.sh/)
* Developing operating system kernels? Have a look at [Mirage OS](https://mirage.io/)
* Developing Linux server software like web servers? Plain old [OCaml on Debian, etc.](https://ocaml.org/docs/up-and-running) works well
* Writing compilers or proofs? Plain old OCaml works really well
* Wanting quick installations? *Use anything but DkML!* DkML will conduct
  from-source builds unless it can guarantee (and code sign) the binaries are
  reproducible. Today that means a lot of compiling.

The DkML Installer for OCaml generates and distributes installers for
the DkML distribution.

Commercial tools and support are available from Diskuv for mixed OCaml/C
development; however, this pure OCaml distribution only has limited support
for mixed OCaml/C. For example, the `ctypes` opam package has been patched
to work with Visual Studio but is out-dated. Contact
support AT diskuv.com if you need OCaml/C development.

## Installing

Run the following in a terminal (either Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt):

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2019.BuildTools --override "--wait --passive --installPath C:\VS --addProductLang En-us --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --includeRecommended"
winget install Git.Git
winget install Diskuv.OCaml
```

And then in a **NEW** terminal:

```powershell
dkml init --system
```

> Any problems installing? Be sure to read the [latest release notes](https://gitlab.com/dkml/distributions/dkml/-/releases).

Once your installation is finished, newcomers to OCaml should continue on with the [OCaml: Learn](https://ocaml.org/docs) site.

## License

The *DkML* distribution uses an open-source, liberal
[Apache v2 license](./LICENSE.txt).

## Quick Start

After installation, open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell, open
an interactive "*full*" REPL with:

```powershell
