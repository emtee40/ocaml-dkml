# conf-withdkml is needed so dune+shim is built+installed correctly
# for any [global-compile] package that needs dune, except for the
# dkml switch which does not install conf-withdkml. So we want
# conf-withdkml to be a runtime decision. That is [create-opam-switch.sh
# -m conf-withdkml] like is done by [dkml init] command.
