opam-version: "2.0"
# Composite version format is M.N.O~vA.B.C[~prelP]
# where:
# - M.N.O is OCaml compiler version
# - A.B.C is the DKML version of the dkml-runtime-common
# - P is optional DKML prerelease version
# Examples:
# - 4.14.0~prerel69 (legacy format) < 4.14.0~v0.4.0 < 4.14.0~v0.4.1~prerel69 < 4.14.0~v0.4.1

synopsis: "OCaml cross-compiler and libraries from the DKML distribution that works with at least Win32 and macOS"
description:
  """The DKML distribution of the OCaml bytecode and native compiler, Stdlib and the other OCaml libraries (str, unix, bigarray, etc.).
A cross-compiler for macOS x86_64 to macOS arm64 is included; for build consistency the regular OCaml compiler will be for x86_64 regardless of whether the build machine is Apple Silicon.
Install with something like: opam switch create dkml-4.14.0 '--formula="dkml-base-compiler" {>= "4.14.0~" & < "4.13.0~"}'"""
