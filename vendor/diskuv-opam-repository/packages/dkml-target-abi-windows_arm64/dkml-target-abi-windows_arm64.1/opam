synopsis: "DkML cross-compile target: Windows/ARM 64-bit"
description: """
This package should be selected if the DkML compiler should cross-compile to
Windows with a 64-bit ARM CPU.

DkML does not support Windows on ARM64 yet, but this package is available
for use in other opam packages to get ready for when DkML does support
Windows on ARM64.

Multiple dkml-target-abi packages may be chosen when multiple ABIs should be available for cross-compilation."""
