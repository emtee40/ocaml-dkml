synopsis: "Common runtime code used in DKML"
description: "Common runtime code used in DKML.

This package has no dependencies and is what you should include
in dependencies of custom OCaml compilers.

The runtime code will be available in the 'lib/dkml-runtime-common-native' folder
of your Opam switch or findlib installation.

If you use opam-monorepo you should install dkml-runtime-common instead."
